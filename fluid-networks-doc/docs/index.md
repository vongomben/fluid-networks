# Fluid Networks

An Physical Computing and Internet of Things workshop from [Officine Innesto](https://officine.cc/) and held by [Davide Gomba](https://twitter.com/vongomben)

This repository is meant as a [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) and Microcontrollers (mainly based on [Arduino](https://arduino.cc/))

Born as a remote-only experience, is now living its second evolutional step as partially online, completely online, or totally *de visu*.

## What is the Fluid Networks Workshop?

Fluid Networks is a list of lessons and good practices, divided in 4 educational units, where students will learn how to create meaningful human-to-machine interactions, together with a selection of sensors and actuators that will eventually help them create interactive projects that will be connected to the internet in various different ways.

Weâ€™ll learn how to connect things together, design conversations or add emotional behaviours to products and experiences.

## Educational Tools

Fluid Networks Workshops massivley use of the [Flipped Classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom).
The goal is giving all students the same, personal, one to one educational experience, while discussing with them (in groups or classroom-wide) the problems they may have found in their Units Deliverables. Almost each Learning Unit has a deliverables.

The Fluid Networks Workshop has been developed and tested during the first Pandemic in 2020, and addressed to several [Istituto Marangoni](https://www.istitutomarangoni.com/en) students, while is being reshaped for Mozilla / Northumrbia University Open Hardware Workshop for the [OpenDoTT PhD Programme](https://opendott.org/) ad well as being used for the first and second year of [Cloud Computing as Internet of Things Development Kit at the ITS ICT of Turin](https://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/corsi/cloud-specialist/), [ITS Biotecnologie](https://www.its-biotecnologiepiemonte.it/) and more.
